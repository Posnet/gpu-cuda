# Stripe CTF3 Solutions

These are my solutions to the Jan 2014 Stripe CTF3 event.  The solutions were roughly:

Level | Implementation | Language
0 | Trie search (marisa-trie) | C
1 | GPU SHA1 hasher | C/CUDA
2 | Blackhole IPs with >4 requests | Javascript
3 | Path-sharded in-memory scan | Scala
4 | Raft-based distributed log | Go
